Import a Posterous backup of XML files into your Habari blog.

This is a pretty inelegant tool, but it gets the job started.

Posterous backups create a bunch of XML files.  Stick these files into the directory for this plugin and then execute it.  It'll create a post for each XML file.

TODO: fix up the HTML of the imported posts to remove the Posterous classes, etc.  Also, properly deal with media assets.  Currently all media link back to their Posterous-hosted locations. :(
